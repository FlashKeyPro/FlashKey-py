## Disclaimer

**FlashKey** is an open-source tool, and while we aim to provide a secure and reliable solution for crypto asset storage, **users are solely responsible for the safekeeping of their private keys and assets**.

- **No liability**: Developers and contributors are not liable for any loss or theft of funds. FlashKey is designed to provide users with full control over their crypto assets, but the responsibility to store and safeguard private keys rests entirely with the user.
- **Risks of Bugs**: As with any open-source software, there may be bugs, vulnerabilities, or unforeseen issues. By using this software, you acknowledge and accept the risks involved.
- **Backup and Recovery**: It is crucial to regularly back up your keys and recovery information. FlashKey does not store or back up private keys, so if you lose access to your keys, you may lose access to your funds.

## Key Principles of the FlashKey Concept:

1. **Physical Security**  
   Private keys are stored on separate flash drives or individual files, reducing the risk of leaks from network attacks.

2. **Decentralized Storage**  
   Assets are distributed across multiple wallets (addresses) to minimize risks.

3. **Privacy**  
   Keys are generated using a live CD/USB, leaving no digital footprint.

4. **Minimalism**  
   Open-source scripts and interfaces allow users to control their assets without relying on complicated software.

5. **Convenience**  
   A flash drive becomes a universal tool, ready to use at any moment.
