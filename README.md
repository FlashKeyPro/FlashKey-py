# FlashKey-py

**FlashKey** as a concept is more than just a wallet. Itâ€™s a system for secure, decentralized storage of crypto assets with a strong focus on physical separation and a unique approach to data protection.

## Key Principles of the FlashKey Concept:

1. **Physical Security**  
   Private keys are stored on separate flash drives or individual files, reducing the risk of leaks from network attacks.

2. **Decentralized Storage**  
   Assets are distributed across multiple wallets (addresses) to minimize risks.

3. **Privacy**  
   Keys are generated using a live CD/USB, leaving no digital footprint.

4. **Minimalism**  
   Open-source scripts and interfaces allow users to control their assets without relying on complicated software.

5. **Convenience**  
   A flash drive becomes a universal tool, ready to use at any moment.

## FlashKey is:

- **A Storage Philosophy**  
  You are your own "bank" for your assets. No intermediaries or servers involved.

- **A Self-Protection Tool**  
  Secure access is only possible with the physical device, acting as a "key."

- **A Foundation for Future Innovations**  
  While the wallet can evolve and gain additional features, its core idea remains unchanged.
